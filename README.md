# André Luiz
<sub>*Backend Developer, Bioinformatician and Data Scientist*</sub>

As a Biomedical Scientist with a specialization in Clinical Pathology and a Master's degree in Microbiology from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at the University of São Paulo (ICB-USP), I have a proven track record of analytical problem-solving and a passion for scientific research. With 7 years of experience in the field, including a focus on bioinformatics and data science, I am actively seeking a challenging role where I can utilize my expertise to drive business operations excellence including backend expertise development.

My approach is to leverage my strong scientific background and analytical skills to pursue a role in data science and bioinformatics. I am a proactive and results-oriented individual, known for my ability to resolve complex problems and excel in high-pressure situations. I have published scientific papers in international journals and worked in one of the largest and most respected research laboratories in the country, providing me with invaluable experience in serious research groups.
