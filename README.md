# André Luiz
<sub>*Bioinformatician and Data Scientist*</sub>

As a Biomedical Scientist with a specialization in Clinical Pathology and a Master's degree in Microbiology from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at the University of São Paulo, I have a proven track record of analytical problem-solving and a passion for scientific research. With 7 years of experience in the field, including a focus on bioinformatics and data science, I am actively seeking a challenging role where I can utilize my expertise to drive business operations excellence.

My approach is to leverage my strong scientific background and analytical skills to pursue a role in data science and bioinformatics. I am a proactive and results-oriented individual, known for my ability to resolve complex problems and excel in high-pressure situations. I have published scientific papers in international journals and worked in one of the largest and most respected research laboratories in the country, providing me with invaluable experience in serious research groups.

With a technical background in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyMol, Chimera UCSF, Phylogeny, Protein Structure, and Alphafold2, I possess the skills required to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data. My clinical background in Clinical Pathology and Analysis, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biochemical Characterization, and Molecular Biology further strengthens my ability to understand and interpret complex biological processes.

I am an accomplished researcher and analytical problem solver with an entrepreneurial spirit and scientific mindset. I am confident that my unique blend of business and technical insight, along with my expertise in bioinformatics and data science, would make me a valuable addition to any team.
